# Aspects Of World Energy Consumption
Data Visualization Project

The Energy resources are divided into two major categories i.e., Non-Renewable Energy resources and Renewable Energy Resources. 
 <br> &emsp;&emsp; 
<B>Non-renewable energy</B> resources come from sources that will eventually run out or will not be replenished in our lifetimes. Most of the non-renewable sources are fossil fuels: Coal, Natural Gas, Oil and Other non-renewable resource like Nuclear energy. Although Nuclear energy is itself a renewable source but the element used in nuclear power plant is not. Non-renewable energy sources are valuable sources of energy but the consumption of these resources can be harmful for the environment thus increasing the Carbon Emission.
 <br> &emsp;&emsp;
<B>Renewable energy</B> sources are those which do not emit Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Renewable sources are: Solar, Wind, Hydro and other renewable sources like Biomass and Geothermal.
 <br> &emsp;&emsp; The project highlights various sources of Energy, its generation and consumption as adopted by world between the period of 1965 to 2019. The main motive is to highlight the tremendous growth of renewable energy sources and its impact on carbon emissions across the world. It is a comparative analysis of assumptions made to identify the level of carbon emissions in absence of renewable energy sources thus concluding drastic reduction of the same accounting to renewable energy sources.
 <br> &emsp;&emsp;Also it highlights, <B>Japan Energy consumption </B> and the energy shift from Nuclear energy generation to Renewable energy generation (since 2011) and hereby tracking down the reductions in carbon emissions.
